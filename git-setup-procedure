How to Get Create, Push and pull from Private Gitrepo. 


Prerequisites : -

1) Need to have id on Github, Create one.
2) Need to know the name of the private Git Repo.  https://github.com/BigStudyGroup/BigStudyGroup
3) Owner of the Private repo should provide you access to the repo. 



Tools Needed: 
-> Gitbash or GitGui or any similar tool  for initialising local project, syncing project to git, pulling and pushing file to the private repo. 




Procedure to initialise the project locally. 

Assuming you already have a github user id. 

-> Open Git bash 
-> Navigate to the local directory where you want to initiate your project. 
   Example, in my case it is "D:/BigStudyGroup-Development/BigStudyGroup"
   
Note: It would be easy to perform git command and sync activities if we setup ssh-keys between git and you id locally. 

Procedure for Generating a new SSH key would be as below.

1) Open Git Bash.

2) Paste the text below, substituting in your GitHub email address.
# ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
This creates a new ssh key, using the provided email as a label.

3) Generating public/private rsa key pair.
When you're prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter. This accepts the default file location.

4) Enter a file in which to save the key (/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa):[Press enter]
At the prompt, type a secure passphrase. 

> Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Type a passphrase]
> Enter same passphrase again: [Type passphrase again]

Copy the contents of "/c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa"  file to you account in git under https://github.com/settings/keys
-Click on New SSH key
- Give name to the key file 
- Copy paste the contents of /c/Users/you/.ssh/id_rsa. And Save.

Once the ssh-keys are uploaded to git. It is time to initiate the  git project. 


Cloning and Adding files to github

1) Via Gitbash, Navigate to the local directory where you want to initiate your project.
2) git init

3) git config --global user.name "<github userid"
4) git config --global user.email "<github-user-emailid@someplace.com>"
5) git add *   or  git add <particular file>
6) git commit -m "some init msg"
7) git push origin master
